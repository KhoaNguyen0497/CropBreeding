# Crop Breeding artwork

The machine asset is a static RGBA PNG with binary transparency and no baked ground shadow. The game retains normal big-craftable rendering. Enlarged previews use nearest-neighbor scaling.

| Asset | Native size | Preview |
|---|---|---|
| `../src/assets/breeding-machine.png` | 16×32 | `breeding-machine-preview.png`, 10× |

Created with the built-in image-generation tool from the user-approved machine design, then exported to native grids using nearest-neighbor sampling and a limited palette (up to 24 colors). The user-supplied vanilla workbench was a style reference, not a shipped asset.

Machine prompt: “A Stardew Valley crop-breeding biology station based on the vanilla wooden workbench. Keep its narrow amber wooden base, drawer and feet. Add a pale blue flask with green liquid, a tiny potted seedling and cream seed specimen tray. Frontal slightly top-down pixel art, limited palette, dark outline, transparent background, no animation, glow or ground shadow.”


The trait badge reuses the vanilla Qi Gem item sprite, `(O)858`, via ItemRegistry. Its native 16×16 sprite is drawn at exactly 2× for a 32×32 badge on a normal 64-pixel inventory/crop icon. No resampled or generated gem artwork is shipped. Inventory badges mean inherited item traits; Crop Harvest Bubbles badges mean a saved successful mutation waiting to be harvested.
